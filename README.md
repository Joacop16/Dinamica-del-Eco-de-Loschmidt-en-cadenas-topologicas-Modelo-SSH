In this degree project, the main object of study was related to a special class of quantum materials: Topological matter. For the study of this materials there are various theoretical models. During this project, the so-called Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is taken as the central system of study. The choice of this theoretical model allows us to study the relationship between two very peculiar phase transitions, the topological phase transitions (TPT) and the dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT). Relationship which is analyzed in the framework of the two possible boundary conditions (PBC - Periodic Boundary Conditions and OBC - Open Boundary Conditions) with the aim of defining an bulk-boundary correspondence.
